## DOS Attack Simulator

A Python-based tool demonstrating HTTP/HTTPS denial-of-service (DoS) attack concepts for educational purposes. This tool is designed to help users understand the mechanics of DoS attacks and how they can be mitigated in real-world scenarios.

### Features
- **Multi-threaded request flooding**: Simulates high-traffic scenarios by sending multiple requests simultaneously.
- **HTTP/HTTPS support**: Works with both HTTP and HTTPS protocols to demonstrate attack vectors.
- **Customizable attack parameters**: Allows users to configure parameters such as target URL, number of threads, and request payloads.
- **Educational code structure**: The code is structured to be easy to read and understand, making it suitable for learning purposes.

### How It Works
The tool generates a large number of HTTP/HTTPS requests to a specified target URL using multiple threads. This simulates a denial-of-service attack by overwhelming the target server with traffic. The program is intended to demonstrate the impact of such attacks and provide insights into how to defend against them.

### Installation
To get started with the tool, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amr-Khaled-Ahmed/Hack-Tools.git
cd Hack-Tools
```

### Usage
After installation, you can run the tool using Python. Below is an example of how to execute the program:

```bash
python dos_attack_simulator.py --url <target_url> --threads <number_of_threads>
```

Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the target server and `<number_of_threads>` with the desired number of threads for the simulation.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of networking and security concepts.
